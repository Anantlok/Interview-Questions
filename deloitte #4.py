"""Problem Statement :

Ratul made a linked list, a list made of n nodes, where every node has two variables, 
the velocity and the mass of a particle.
Since all the particles have the velocity in the same direction
find the total momentum of the entity made by the particles from the linked list.
Constraints :
1<=n<=10000
1<=m,v<=100
Input format:
First line containing n, number of nodes
Then n lines containing the mass and the velocity space separated.
Output Format:
Single integer denoting the momentum
Sample Input:
4
1 3
2 4
2 3
4 5
Sample Output:
37"""
n = int (input())
s=0
for i in range (n):
	m,v= map(int,input().split())
	s+=m*v
print(s)
