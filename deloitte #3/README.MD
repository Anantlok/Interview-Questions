# Question 3 : Help of Prepsters

## Problem Statement
Arnab has given you a challenge:  
You must calculate the number of integers **less than** a given value `n`  
that have **exactly `k` set bits** in their binary representation.

As a fellow Prepster, help solve the problem by writing a program that:
- Takes `n` and `k` as input
- Outputs the count of such numbers

---

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 10000`
- `1 ≤ k ≤ 10`

---

## Input Format
1. A single line containing two integers `n` and `k` separated by a space.

---

## Output Format
- A single integer representing the number of numbers less than `n` with exactly `k` set bits.
