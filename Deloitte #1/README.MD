<h2><a href="#">Class Monitor Selection</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><p>After JEE Mains, some students got admission into an engineering college. Now there is a class consisting of <code>n</code> students, and the HOD came to say it is time to select the class monitor. But he never gets all of them at one time. So he brought a register, and every time he gets someone with a <strong>lower rank</strong> than the previous time, he <em>cuts</em> the name and writes the new student's name and rank.</p> <p>For a given number of ranks he gets each time, you have to predict how many names are cut from the list.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p> <pre> <strong>Input:</strong> N = 6 ranks = [4, 3, 7, 2, 6, 1] <strong>Output:</strong> 3 <strong>Explanation:</strong> - First student rank = 4 (no cut yet) - Second student rank = 3 (cut, since 3 < 4) - Third student rank = 7 (no cut, since 7 > 3) - Fourth student rank = 2 (cut, since 2 < 7) - Fifth student rank = 6 (no cut, since 6 > 2) - Sixth student rank = 1 (cut, since 1 < 6) Total cuts = 3 </pre> <p>&nbsp;</p> <strong>Constraints:</strong> <ul> <li><code>1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li> <li><code>1 &lt;= ranks[i] &lt;= 10000</code></li> </ul>
